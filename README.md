# 🎅 Advent of Code Solutions ☃️

This repository contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges, which consist of algorithmic problems.<br>
Advent of Code is an annual programming event that takes place every December, with new algorithmic problems released each day.

## 🎄 Repository Structure

The repository is organized with the following structure:

```
AdventOfCode
│
├── <Year>

```

- `<Year>`: Each folder corresponds to a specific year of Advent of Code.
- `<Day>`: Each day's folder contains solutions for that day's challenges.
- `<Language> Solution`: Within each day's folder, there's a subfolder for each programming language used.
- `solution.<extension>`: Inside each language's folder, there is the solution file written in the specified language.
